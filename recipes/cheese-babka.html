        <h4>step by step directions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Sprinkle the yeast and the pinch of sugar over the warm water; 
                    stir to dissolve. Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine the 1/2 cup butter, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, 2 teaspoons of vanilla,
                     milk, and 3 eggs in a bowl with 1 cup of flour and mix well. 
                     Add the yeast mixture and beat for 1 minute. Gradually add the 
                     remaining flour to form a soft dough. Turn the dough onto a lightly 
                     floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, adding small 
                     amounts of flour as necessary to prevent sticking. Shape the dough 
                     into a round, and place it in a greased bowl, turning to coat. 
                     Cover with plastic wrap and let the dough rise at room temperature 
                     until doubled in size, about 1 1/2 hours.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Beat together the farmers' cheese, 1/3 cup sugar, sour cream, 1 egg, 
                    1 teaspoon vanilla extract, and dried lemon peel in a bowl until smooth.
                     Set the filling aside. Lightly oil a 10-inch fluted tube pan 
                     (such as a Bundt®).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface and pat into a 10-inch by
                     12-inch rectangle. Brush the dough with the 2 tablespoons of melted 
                     butter. Spread the cheese filling evenly over the dough. Roll the 
                     dough up like a jelly roll, starting from the long end; twist the 
                     dough 6 to 8 times to form a rope. Pinch the seams and ends closed 
                     and arrange the rope of dough in the greased pan. Cover loosely and 
                     let rise 1 hour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Bake the babka until deep golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes.
                     Remove from oven and let stand for 5 minutes; invert the babka onto 
                     a wire rack and remove the pan. Allow the babka to cool for at 
                     least 2 hours before slicing.
