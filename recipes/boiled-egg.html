                    Combine salt, vinegar, and water in a large pot, and bring to a boil 
                    over high heat. Add eggs one at a time, being careful not to crack 
                    them. Reduce the heat to a gentle boil, and cook for 14 minutes.

                    Once eggs have cooked, remove them from the hot water, and place into a
                     container of ice water or cold, running water. Cool completely, about 
                     15 minutes. Store in the refrigerator up to 1 week.
